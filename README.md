## Features

This extension provides code completion & snippets for Foundation 6 for Sites SASS mixins and HTML navigation, containers and media snippets. It also contains many 'data-' js plugin options.

## Limitations

I developed this extension primary for myself, so it focuses on semantic mark-up and relies on the xy-grid and flexbox. Older grids are missing, as are many non-semantic html classes. I also did not include SASS variables. I welcome pull requests to fill-in anything that's missing. Thanks!
